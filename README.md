# Scribe For Ruby Made Easy

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/highgroove/scribe-rb.png)](http://travis-ci.org/highgroove/scribe-rb)

To use [Scribe](https://github.com/facebook/scribe), you usually have to
use [Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/) to generate Ruby code
from generic *.thrift files.

This gem tries to alleviate that slight annoyance and package everything
you need to communicate with Scribe.

## Installation

Add to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scribe-rb'
```

## Producer (Client)

```ruby
# Setup
socket = Thrift::Socket.new('localhost', 1463)

transport = Thrift::FramedTransport.new(socket)
transport.open

protocol = Thrift::BinaryProtocol.new(transport, false)
client   = Scribe::Client.new(protocol)

# Logging
log_entry = LogEntry.new(:category => 'default', :message => 'This is a test message')
client.Log([log_entry])

# Teardown
transport.close
```

## Consumer (Server)

```ruby
# Define a handler that inherits from FacebookService::BaseHandler
class MyScribeHandler < FacebookService::BaseHandler
  def Log(messages)
    # Process the array of LogEntry instances passed
    messages.each do |message|
      puts "#{message.category}: #{message.message}"
    end

    # If messages were processed correctly, return `ResultCode::OK`
    #
    # To tell the Scribe producer/broker to resend messages later (e.g.,
    # because this process is under too much load), return
    # `ResultCode::TRY_LATER`

    # Must return `ResultCode::OK` or `ResultCode::TRY_LATER`
    ResultCode::OK
  end
end

# Setup
handler   = MyScribeHandler.new("My Scribe Handler")
processor = Scribe::Processor.new(handler)

transport = Thrift::ServerSocket.new(5678) # 5678 is port number

transportFactory = Thrift::FramedTransportFactory.new
protocolFactory  = Thrift::NonStrictBinaryProtocolFactory.new

# There are multiple options for server type
# * [Thrift::SimpleServer](http://rubydoc.info/gems/thrift/0.7.0/Thrift/SimpleServer): single threaded server (simplest)
# * [Thrift::ThreadedServer](http://rubydoc.info/gems/thrift/0.7.0/Thrift/ThreadedServer): server that spawns a thread to handle messages
# * [Thrift::ThreadPoolServer](http://rubydoc.info/gems/thrift/0.7.0/Thrift/ThreadPoolServer): server that uses a constant number of threads as workers
# * [Thrift::NonblockingServer](http://rubydoc.info/gems/thrift/0.7.0/Thrift/NonblockingServer): server that uses non-blocking I/O
server = Thrift::SimpleServer.new(processor, transport, transportFactory, protocolFactory)
server.serve
```
